## Requirements
To run this program, you need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and the following libraries:   
  * Mathplotlib 
  * Numpy
  * Scipy

Additionally, to view each change in the sorting algorithm, create a folder named "frames" in your working directory. This is where images of the sorting process will be stored.
